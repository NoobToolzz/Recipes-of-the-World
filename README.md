# Recipes of the World

## About <a name = "about"></a>

"Recipes of the World" is a school project website which I am releasing open-source for all to view.

This project was made with the help of [uiverse](https://uiverse.io) and their outstanding collection of CSS snippets.

Some things I added to those snippets, like pop out animations.
