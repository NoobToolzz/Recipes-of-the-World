# Recipes of the World

### This website is still in progress. If you're seeing this, expect unfinished results.
### UPDATE: I'm not committing here anymore, GitHub pages is broken when it comes to pulling files from sub-directories, leading to my styles and js scripts failing to load.
### If you know how to fix this, feel free to create a PR.

## About <a name = "about"></a>

"Recipes of the World" is a school project website which I am releasing open-source for all to view.

This project was made with the help of [uiverse](https://uiverse.io) and their outstanding collection of CSS snippets.

Some things I added to those snippets, like pop out animations.
